Here is the sn-bibliography.bib file, populated with the 10 most critical references. I have included the 2026 Anand et al. HST paper and the foundational Adams (2022) periodicity paper you and Kimi identified as the "tuning fork" leverage.

Note for Kimi:
I’ve tagged Adams (2022) as the primary source for the "periodicity" justification. When you run the Overleaf compile, make sure the \bibliography{sn-bibliography} command points to this file.
Would you like me to draft the Figure 1 caption now so you can drop it into the \begin{figure} block?
